Inventory/Items:
- Make "InventorySlotList" dynamic so that further itemslots can be added (like a backpack).
	- Make a scaler for the inventory UI BG to fit any amount of itemslots.
- Make UI for each item, so it displays more info (Name, amount and weight)
- Pickups pointed at must give more information based on the item pointed at (like the "Skyrim" I've done)

Inventory Management:
- DragDrop element needs to be picked 1 of when right-clicking
- While right-clicking a DragDrop element, scroll mouse wheel to add more to the amount
- DragDrop element needs to be picked Half (rounded up) of when mouse wheel is clicked
- If dropped on the same slot, just reset the action, with no change in result

- Add Slot to Inventory
- Remove Slot from Inventory
- Remove Item from Inventory

- Change "CreafteableItemDisplay" to match the new Inventory System
