Inventory/Items:
- Make "InventorySlotList" dynamic so that further itemslots can be added (like a backpack).
	- Make a scaler for the inventory UI BG to fit any amount of itemslots.
- Make each inventorySlot have a stack (not just a single item) in it.
- Make UI for each item, so it displays more info (Name, amount and weight)
- Pickups pointed at must give more information based on the item pointed at (like the "Skyrim" I've done)

- Make it possible to swap places with "DrageableObjects" in the inventory
