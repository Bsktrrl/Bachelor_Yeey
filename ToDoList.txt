BuildingSystem:
- Make "Ghosts" transparent AND raytraceable
- Remove BlockGhost when placing a Buildingblock to prevent overlap

- Finetune all Models to match their "DirectionMarkers" to their models, intuitively (ex. "Wood_Stair - Up" is too high)
	- This will most probably remove the overlap-bugs that happens fequently (the Models have gotten other hitboxes now)

- Add UI to select all BuildingBlocks of each type
	- When "buildingHammer" is in hand, hold down "Right_MouseButton" to get the Menu
	- Hover over a Type to open selection of "Wood", "Stone" and "Iron" of that Type
	- When Cursor hover over a BlockTypeButton, it is selected
	- When releasing the "Right_MouseButton", hide the Menu

- Add "Rotation" to each BuildingBlock

- Add Crafting functionality when placing Blocks
	- Make material "Red" when there's not enough items in the Inventory
	- Block cannot be placed when not enough items in Inventory

- Make functionality for placeing the the first block (must be a "Floor"-Block correctly leveled with the ground)


//--------------------


Inventory/Items:
- Make "InventorySlotList" dynamic so that further itemslots can be added (like a backpack).
	- Make a scaler for the inventory UI BG to fit any amount of itemslots.
- Pickups pointed at (in the world) must give more information based on the item pointed at (like the "Skyrim" I've done)

- Make Chest Spawneable (the player can place it in the world) when Holding an item of it

Inventory Menu
- Remove Slot from Inventory
	- Be aware if itemSlot has an Item on it when removed (spawn it in the world instead)
- Remove Item from Inventory (spawn it in the world instead)

- Remove Buggs with more buttons clicked at once
- Remove Sort-bugg with items of stack 1
