BuildingSystem:
- Make "Ghosts" transparent AND raytraceable
- Remove BlockGhost when placing a Buildingblock to prevent overlap

- Finetune all Models to match their "DirectionMarkers" to their models, intuitively (ex. "Wood_Stair - Up" is too high)
	- This will most probably remove the overlap-bugs that happens fequently (the Models have gotten other hitboxes now)

-----

- Add UI to select all BuildingBlocks of each type
	- When "BuildingHammer" is in hand, hold down "Right_MouseButton" to get the Menu
	- Hover over a Type to open selection of "Wood", "Stone" and "Iron" of that Type
	- When Cursor hover over a BlockTypeButton, it is selected
	- When releasing the "Right_MouseButton", hide the Menu

- Add the functionality of Removing a Block when looking at it while having an "Axe" item in your Hand
	- Be able to get some of the used resources back to the Inventory when removing a Block

- Add "Rotation" to each BuildingBlock
	- Experiment with only rotating the Block
	- If not working, add new GhostBlocks to each Model

- Add Crafting functionality when placing Blocks
	- Make material "Red" when there's not enough items in the Inventory
	- A Block cannot be placed when not enough items in Inventory

- Add Detection on each GhostBlock so that the player cannot place a Block in range of another GameObject
	- Make the GhostBlock Material "Red"

- Add "Change Block"-functionality where the "BuildingHammer" can be set to "Change" and 1 of the 3 materials
	- When pointing on a block, replace it with the block of the selected Material
	- Use items based on building the new Block
	- Recieve items based on "remove"-settings

- Make functionality for placeing the the first block (must be a "Floor"-Block correctly leveled with the ground)

- Make Save/Load-system when placing BuildingBlocks
	- Make a Class with all relevant information
	- Make a list of this class which are save/load-able
	- Update this list when successfully placing and removing a block

Inventory/Items:
- Make "InventorySlotList" dynamic so that further itemslots can be added (like a backpack).
	- Make a scaler for the inventory UI BG to fit any amount of itemslots.
- Pickups pointed at (in the world) must give more information based on the item pointed at (like the "Skyrim" I've done)

- Make Chest Spawneable (the player can place it in the world) when Holding an item of it

Inventory Menu
- Remove Slot from Inventory
	- Be aware if itemSlot has an Item on it when removed (spawn it in the world instead)
