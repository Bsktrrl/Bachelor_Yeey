Inventory/Items:
- Make "InventorySlotList" dynamic so that further itemslots can be added (like a backpack).
	- Make a scaler for the inventory UI BG to fit any amount of itemslots.
- Pickups pointed at(in the world) must give more information based on the item pointed at (like the "Skyrim" I've done)

Inventory Menu
- Add Slot to Inventory
- Remove Slot from Inventory
	- Be aware if itemSlot has an Item on it when removed (spawn it in the world instead)
- Remove Item from Inventory (spawn it in the world instead)

- Change "CreafteableItemDisplay" to match the new Inventory System

Crafting Menu:
- Add a crafting panel as in Raft, on the left side
