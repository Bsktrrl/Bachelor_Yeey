Inventory/Items:
- Make "InventorySlotList" dynamic so that further itemslots can be added (like a backpack).
	- Make a scaler for the inventory UI BG to fit any amount of itemslots.
- Pickups pointed at (in the world) must give more information based on the item pointed at (like the "Skyrim" I've done)

- Make HandPanel Scrollable and give selectedSlot with current Item
- Make Chest Crafteable
- Make Chest Spawneable (the player can place it in the world) when Holding an item of it
